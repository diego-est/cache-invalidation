        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/cache-invalidation/posts/asian-culture-festival/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Asian Culture Festival Website" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UPR-RP Asian Culture Festival is happening in 2 weeks from now.
All of us are finishing our preparations and starting our last finishing
practices for it.
One thing I noticed was that most of the pictures from last year were buried in
an instagram blogpost from last year.
Which is somewhat unfortunate since lots of beautiful pictures and moments were
created from that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a better way to revive those memories and instill excitement in others than
with an online gallery of the Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;&#34; &gt;Asian Culture Festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>New Website cache-invalidation</title>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-website&#34;&gt;New website&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I had tried making several different websites to organize different
singular projects but I quickly realized that was way too much work for whatever
those projects were. Most of my projects aren&amp;rsquo;t finished because I lose the
motivation to do so. Nevertheless, my motivation to start projects is enough to
get them to a fully working state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this so I could organize all my different projects in a single place in
an easy way. Most of my projects were distributed around my github profile into
different repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to seeing if any new projects will spring up because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to GitHub repo: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/Sunglas/cache-invalidation&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/Sunglas/cache-invalidation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
