## Colors
I used `pywal` to generate this colorscheme, feel free to do the same.

Black:   #222F30
Grey:    #A59D9C
Red:     #86999B
Green:   #86A78F
Yellow:  #8592A5
Blue:    #87B0AF
Magenta: #B0A7A9
Cyan:    #DCBCB6
White:   #EDE1E0

## fetch program
Provided is a rust crate called `fetch` with a basic template to make a hard-coded fetch program.
(That's the one I used for the screenshots.)
The program displays:
```

  UserName@HostName
  Distro  ~ DistroName
  Shell   ~ ShellName
  Term    ~ Terminal
  WM      ~ WindowManager
  ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅

```

So simply modify the variables in the source file to fit your setup and `cargo build --release` to get the binary.
(Tip: I copied the binary over to `./local/bin/`.)

## Assets

### Firefox startpage

### Wallpaper
Could not find the original artist for the background but I found this wallhaven post with a pretty high res version saved.

## firefox startpage
### Startpage
***WARNING:*** _**do not** apply this without considering the vulnerabilities it opens up._
* [See this CVE](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/#CVE-2019-11730)

I copied most of what's in this:
(I added the lil' gif at the side and changed some of the website links.)

In order to have this work you will have to let firefox to be able to view `file://` from within a locally hosted html file.
I'm guessing you could get around having to disable these security policies by locally hosting the html but I'm not quite there yet...

Provided is a user.js inside `.mozilla/firefox/default-release` with the necessary changes to make.
More specifically, these three lines (as documented in mozillazine):
```js
user_pref("capability.policy.policynames", "localfilelinks");
user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.sites", "file://");
user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.checkloaduri.enabled", "allAccess");
```
* [mozillazine](https://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work)

Additionally, if you are running the latest version of firefox (hopefully):
Toggle `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` to `false` in your `about:config` page.

### Other Firefox css tweaks
I copied `color_variable_template` and `autohide_tabstoolbar` templates from this incredible firefox css website:
* https://mrotherguy.github.io/firefox-csshacks/

The `userChrome.css` provided under `.mozilla/firefox/default-release/chrome` already has these css patches applied and should be placed inside the `chrome` directory that *you* have to make inside your firefox local directory.
Your firefox local directory can be found in `about:profiles`.

## Vim
I did not theme much of what's on my vim other than enabling a couple options.
Most of it (but basically all of it) comes from the amazing team over at AstroNvim .
Additionally, my nvim version is `0.8.0` and was installed through bob-nvim.

* [bob-nvim](https://crates.io/crates/bob-nvim)

## shell
As seen in my screenshot I am using nushell.
A new type of shell that deals with data instead of simple text streams.
Very interesting and fast out of the box (even on my 2008 hardware).
**NOTE** I have a bunch of aliases at the end of my nushell config file that replace most of the gnu coreutils with rust implementations of each.
* [nushell Website](https://www.nushell.sh/)
* [UUtils GitHub](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils)

## Sway
### I am not using the upstream sway.
I am using swayfx.
A fork of sway that adds corners, shadows and active/inactive dim.
That means that the options under the swayfx area in my sway config will most definitely give you errors when launching the upstream sway istead of swayfx sway.
* [swayfx GitHub](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx)

### dvorak
***IMPORTANT***
My keybinds and input layout in sway are set to a dvorak keyboard.
So if you are using a normal qwerty keyboard remember to change the layout back to normal in the sway config and possibly change the sway keybinds around in the keymap config.
