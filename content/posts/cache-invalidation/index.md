# New website
In the past I had tried making several different websites to organize different
singular projects but I quickly realized that was way too much work for whatever
those projects were. Most of my projects aren't finished because I lose the
motivation to do so. Nevertheless, my motivation to start projects is enough to
get them to a fully working state.

I made this so I could organize all my different projects in a single place in
an easy way. Most of my projects were distributed around my github profile into
different repos.

Here's to seeing if any new projects will spring up because of this.
